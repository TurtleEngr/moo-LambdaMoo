This directory contains the patches that are recommended for UNIX servers 
running the Diversity University eduCore MOO database.  The patches and 
installation recommendations are available individually, and also 
together as a tar.gz file.

The LambdaMOO server itself must be obtained from the appropriate site, as 
Diversity University does not provide this resource.  As of March 10th, 
1997, the most recent version is 1.8.0p6 available at:
    ftp://ftp.research.att.com/dist/eostrom/MOO

Instructions for compiling the MOO Server are found in the "README" file
that comes with the LambdaMOO Server package.  The "patch_installation.txt"
file in this directory gives instructions for installing the patches, which
must be done before the server is compiled.

Instructions on setting up a recommended directory structure for the MOO
files, and arranging security for group of maintainers, may be found at:
