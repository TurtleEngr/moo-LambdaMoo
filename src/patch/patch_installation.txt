Patching the LambdaMOO Server Version 1.8.0p6 for the EduCore
*************************************************************

If you are going to run the eduCore on a UNIX system, there are 
several server patches that are desirable.  Patches should be installed 
by creating a subdirectory named "patches" in the location of the 
MOO server source files, and copying the patches to there.  Then, from the 
MOO server source files directory, use:

	patch -l < patches/patchfile

where "patchfile" is the name of the patch file to apply.  Note that 
patch command switch is the letter "ell" and not the number one.

We suggest the following procedure:

1. Unpack the server package.  It should create a directory named 
   MOO-1.8.0p6 containing all the source files.
       gzip -dc LambdaMOO-1.8.0p6.tar.Z | tar -xf -
2. From in the MOO-1.8.0p6 directory, issue "sh configure" to create a 
   Makefile file for your system.
3. Edit the options.h files, as described in the LambdaMOO server README 
   file.  Usually, the only changes to make are to set the port and to 
   uncomment the OUTBOUND_NETWORK line.
4. Use "make" to compile the server.  If the server doesn't compile, first 
   solve that problem before dealing with any patches.
5. If the server compiles successfully, proceed with installing the 
   patches.
6. Create a "patches" subdirectory in the MOO-1.8.0p6 directory, and place 
   all the unpacked patches there.
7. Edit the patches as needed, as described below.
8. Install the patches using the "patch" utility.
9. Use "make" again to recompile the server.

If the server now won't compile, start over, but this time recompile (with 
"make") after each patch is installed to determine which is the culprit.  
None of the patches is actually critical for operation of the eduCore.

If you place the patch files as described, then you'll be using the 
following set of commands to install them:

patch -l < patches/moo-1.8.0-pAS9.patch
patch -l < patches/moo-1.8.0-pAS5.patch
patch -l < patches/moo-1.8.0-pAS5.c.patch
patch -l < patches/moo-1.8.0-FUP.patch
patch -l < patches/moo-1.8.0-files.c.patch
and possibly
patch -l < patches/moo-1.8.0-FUP.errfix.patch

________

The recommended patches are:

pAS5

  Description: Written by Alex Stewart.  Provides additional built-in 
functions that allow the MOO to access certain UNIX time zone functions.  
That is preferable to using the plain MOO server's rather weak support for 
time zones.
  File names: moo-1.8.0-pAS5.patch and moo-1.8.0-pAS5.c.patch
  Installation:  Although it might not be absolutely needed on your 
machine, it's probably a good idea to set the TZ variable in the 
moo-1.8.0-pAS5.c.patch file.  Look for the line
    + static char tzdefault[] = "TZ=localtime";
And change `localtime' to the appropriate UNIX time zone for your 
site (e.g. US/Eastern).  Save the changed patch file, and install BOTH 
patches, in the standard way.

pAS9

  Description: Written by Alex Stewart.  Provides backspace support for 
bad telnet clients.  Some really poor telnet clients handle 
backspace/delete keys in a nonstandard way.  This patch makes the MOO a 
bit more forgiving for those.
  File name: moo-1.8.0-pAS9.patch
  Installation: Install the patch in the standard way.

FUP

  Description: Written by Jaime Prilusky and Gustavo Glusman.  This is 
the File Utiltiies Pacakage system, written as patch files.  FUP allows 
the MOO to store various sections of database information externally in 
files on the UNIX server.  See the FUP documentation for more details 
on custom configuration of the FUP system.  This patchfile is set to 
provide the most commonly desired configuration.
  File names: moo-1.8.0-FUP.patch and moo-1.8.0-files.c.patch
  Installation: Install BOTH patches in the standard way.

FUP.errfix

  Description: This patch is to be used ONLY if there is a problem with 
version.c after you try using "make" to compile the system.  If you get 
the error "`FUP_version' undeclared (first use this function)" and the 
compilation fails.
  File name: moo-1.8.0-FUP.errfix.patch
  Installation: Install this patch in the standard way, but ONLY if you 
get the stated error when compiling.  After applying the patch, issue 
the "make" command again to recompile.
