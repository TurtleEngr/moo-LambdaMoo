<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Function:</U> obj <B>create</B> <I>(obj <VAR>parent</VAR> [, obj <VAR>owner</VAR>])</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX54"></A>
Creates and returns a new object whose parent is <VAR>parent</VAR> and whose owner
is as described below.  Either the given <VAR>parent</VAR> object must be <CODE>#-1</CODE>
or valid and fertile (i.e., its <SAMP>`f'</SAMP> bit must be set) or else the
programmer must own <VAR>parent</VAR> or be a wizard; otherwise <CODE>E_PERM</CODE> is
raised.  <CODE>E_PERM</CODE> is also raised if <VAR>owner</VAR> is provided and not
the same as the programmer, unless the programmer is a wizard.  After the new
object is created, its <CODE>initialize</CODE> verb, if any, is called with no
arguments.

</P>
<P>
The new object is assigned the least non-negative object number that has not
yet been used for a created object.  Note that no object number is ever reused,
even if the object with that number is recycled.

</P>
<P>
The owner of the new object is either the programmer (if <VAR>owner</VAR> is not
provided), the new object itself (if <VAR>owner</VAR> was given as <CODE>#-1</CODE>), or
<VAR>owner</VAR> (otherwise).

</P>
<P>
The other built-in properties of the new object are initialized as follows:

<PRE>
name         ""
location     #-1
contents     {}
programmer   0
wizard       0
r            0
w            0
f            0
</PRE>

<P>
The function <SAMP>`is_player()'</SAMP> returns false for newly created objects.

</P>
<P>
In addition, the new object inherits all of the other properties on
<VAR>parent</VAR>.  These properties have the same permission bits as on
<VAR>parent</VAR>.  If the <SAMP>`c'</SAMP> permissions bit is set, then the owner of the
property on the new object is the same as the owner of the new object itself;
otherwise, the owner of the property on the new object is the same as that on
<VAR>parent</VAR>.  The initial value of every inherited property is <STRONG>clear</STRONG>;
see the description of the built-in function <CODE>clear_property()</CODE> for
details.

</P>
<P>
If the intended owner of the new object has a property named
<SAMP>`ownership_quota'</SAMP> and the value of that property is an integer, then
<CODE>create()</CODE> treats that value as a <STRONG>quota</STRONG>.  If the quota is less than
or equal to zero, then the quota is considered to be exhausted and
<CODE>create()</CODE> raises <CODE>E_QUOTA</CODE> instead of creating an object.
Otherwise, the quota is decremented and stored back into the
<SAMP>`ownership_quota'</SAMP> property as a part of the creation of the new object.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Function:</U> none <B>chparent</B> <I>(obj <VAR>object</VAR>, obj <VAR>new-parent</VAR>)</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX55"></A>
Changes the parent of <VAR>object</VAR> to be <VAR>new-parent</VAR>.  If <VAR>object</VAR> is
not valid, or if <VAR>new-parent</VAR> is neither valid nor equal to <CODE>#-1</CODE>,
then <CODE>E_INVARG</CODE> is raised.  If the programmer is neither a wizard or the
owner of <VAR>object</VAR>, or if <VAR>new-parent</VAR> is not fertile (i.e., its
<SAMP>`f'</SAMP> bit is not set) and the programmer is neither the owner of
<VAR>new-parent</VAR> nor a wizard, then <CODE>E_PERM</CODE> is raised.  If
<VAR>new-parent</VAR> is equal to <CODE>object</CODE> or one of its current ancestors,
<CODE>E_RECMOVE</CODE> is raised.  If <VAR>object</VAR> or one of its descendants
defines a property with the same name as one defined either on <VAR>new-parent</VAR>
or on one of its ancestors, then <CODE>E_INVARG</CODE> is raised.

</P>
<P>
Changing an object's parent can have the effect of removing some properties
from and adding some other properties to that object and all of its descendants
(i.e., its children and its children's children, etc.).  Let <VAR>common</VAR> be
the nearest ancestor that <VAR>object</VAR> and <VAR>new-parent</VAR> have in common
before the parent of <VAR>object</VAR> is changed.  Then all properties defined by
ancestors of <VAR>object</VAR> under <VAR>common</VAR> (that is, those ancestors of
<VAR>object</VAR> that are in turn descendants of <VAR>common</VAR>) are removed from
<VAR>object</VAR> and all of its descendants.  All properties defined by
<VAR>new-parent</VAR> or its ancestors under <VAR>common</VAR> are added to <VAR>object</VAR>
and all of its descendants.  As with <CODE>create()</CODE>, the newly-added
properties are given the same permission bits as they have on <VAR>new-parent</VAR>,
the owner of each added property is either the owner of the object it's added
to (if the <SAMP>`c'</SAMP> permissions bit is set) or the owner of that property on
<VAR>new-parent</VAR>, and the value of each added property is <STRONG>clear</STRONG>; see the
description of the built-in function <CODE>clear_property()</CODE> for details.  All
properties that are not removed or added in the reparenting process are
completely unchanged.

</P>
<P>
If <VAR>new-parent</VAR> is equal to <CODE>#-1</CODE>, then <VAR>object</VAR> is given no
parent at all; it becomes a new root of the parent/child hierarchy.  In this
case, all formerly inherited properties on <VAR>object</VAR> are simply removed.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Function:</U> int <B>valid</B> <I>(obj <VAR>object</VAR>)</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX56"></A>
Returns a non-zero integer (i.e., a true value) if <VAR>object</VAR> is a valid
object (one that has been created and not yet recycled) and zero (i.e., a false
value) otherwise.

</P>

<PRE>
valid(#0)    =>   1
valid(#-1)   =>   0
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Function:</U> obj <B>parent</B> <I>(obj <VAR>object</VAR>)</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX57"></A>
<DT><U>Function:</U> list <B>children</B> <I>(obj <VAR>object</VAR>)</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX58"></A>
These functions return the parent and a list of the children of <VAR>object</VAR>,
respectively.  If <VAR>object</VAR> is not valid, then <CODE>E_INVARG</CODE> is raised.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Function:</U> none <B>recycle</B> <I>(obj <VAR>object</VAR>)</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX59"></A>
The given <VAR>object</VAR> is destroyed, irrevocably.  The programmer must either
own <VAR>object</VAR> or be a wizard; otherwise, <CODE>E_PERM</CODE> is raised.  If
<VAR>object</VAR> is not valid, then <CODE>E_INVARG</CODE> is raised.  The children of
<VAR>object</VAR> are reparented to the parent of <VAR>object</VAR>.  Before <VAR>object</VAR>
is recycled, each object in its contents is moved to <CODE>#-1</CODE> (implying a
call to <VAR>object</VAR>'s <CODE>exitfunc</CODE> verb, if any) and then <VAR>object</VAR>'s
<SAMP>`recycle'</SAMP> verb, if any, is called with no arguments.

</P>
<P>
After <VAR>object</VAR> is recycled, if the owner of the former object has a
property named <SAMP>`ownership_quota'</SAMP> and the value of that property is a
integer, then <CODE>recycle()</CODE> treats that value as a <STRONG>quota</STRONG> and increments
it by one, storing the result back into the <SAMP>`ownership_quota'</SAMP> property.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Function:</U> int <B>object_bytes</B> <I>(obj <VAR>object</VAR>)</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX60"></A>
Returns the number of bytes of the server's memory required to store the given
<VAR>object</VAR>, including the space used by the values of all of its non-clear
properties and by the verbs and properties defined directly on the object.
Raised <CODE>E_INVARG</CODE> if <VAR>object</VAR> is not a valid object and <CODE>E_PERM</CODE>
if the programmer is not a wizard.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Function:</U> obj <B>max_object</B> <I>()</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX61"></A>
Returns the largest object number yet assigned to a created object.  Note that
the object with this number may no longer exist; it may have been recycled.
The next object created will be assigned the object number one larger than the
value of <CODE>max_object()</CODE>.
