<P>
The <CODE>.program</CODE> command is a common way for programmers to associate a
particular MOO-code program with a particular verb.  It has the following
syntax:

</P>

<PRE>
.program <VAR>object</VAR>:<VAR>verb</VAR>
...<VAR>several lines of MOO code</VAR>...
.
</PRE>

<P>
That is, after typing the <CODE>.program</CODE> command, then all lines of input from
the player are considered to be a part of the MOO program being defined.  This
ends as soon as the player types a line containing only a dot (<SAMP>`.'</SAMP>).  When
that line is received, the accumulated MOO program is checked for proper MOO
syntax and, if correct, associated with the named verb.

</P>
<P>
If, at the time the line containing only a dot is processed, (a) the player is
not a programmer, (b) the player does not have write permission on the named
verb, or (c) the property <CODE>$server_options.protect_set_verb_code</CODE> exists
and has a true value and the player is not a wizard, then an error message is
printed and the named verb's program is not changed.

</P>
<P>
In the <CODE>.program</CODE> command, <VAR>object</VAR> may have one of three forms:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The name of some object visible to the player.  This is exactly like the kind
of matching done by the server for the direct and indirect objects of ordinary
commands.  See the chapter on command parsing for details.  Note that the
special names <SAMP>`me'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`here'</SAMP> may be used.

<LI>

An object number, in the form <CODE>#<VAR>number</VAR></CODE>.

<LI>

A <STRONG>system property</STRONG> (that is, a property on <CODE>#0</CODE>), in the form
<CODE>$<VAR>name</VAR></CODE>.  In this case, the current value of <CODE>#0.<VAR>name</VAR></CODE>
must be a valid object.
</UL>
