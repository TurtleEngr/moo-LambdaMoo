<H4><A NAME="SEC19" HREF="ProgrammersManual_toc.html#TOC19">Replacing an Element of a List or String</A></H4>

<P>
It often happens that one wants to change just one particular slot of a list or
string, which is stored in a variable or a property.  This can be done
conveniently using an <STRONG>indexed assignment</STRONG> having one of the following
forms:

</P>

<PRE>
<VAR>variable</VAR>[<VAR>index-expr</VAR>] = <VAR>result-expr</VAR>
<VAR>object-expr</VAR>.<VAR>name</VAR>[<VAR>index-expr</VAR>] = <VAR>result-expr</VAR>
<VAR>object-expr</VAR>.(<VAR>name-expr</VAR>)[<VAR>index-expr</VAR>] = <VAR>result-expr</VAR>
$<VAR>name</VAR>[<VAR>index-expr</VAR>] = <VAR>result-expr</VAR>
</PRE>

<P>
The first form writes into a variable, and the last three forms write into a
property.  The usual errors (<CODE>E_TYPE</CODE>, <CODE>E_INVIND</CODE>, <CODE>E_PROPNF</CODE>
and <CODE>E_PERM</CODE> for lack of read/write permission on the property) may be
raised, just as in reading and writing any object property; see the
discussion of object property expressions below for details.  Correspondingly,
if <VAR>variable</VAR> does not yet have a value (i.e., it has never been assigned
to), <CODE>E_VARNF</CODE> will be raised.

</P>
<P>
If <VAR>index-expr</VAR> is not an integer, or if the value of <VAR>variable</VAR> or the
property is not a list or string, <CODE>E_TYPE</CODE> is raised.  If
<VAR>result-expr</VAR> is a string, but not of length 1, <CODE>E_INVARG</CODE> is
raised.  Now suppose <VAR>index-expr</VAR> evaluates to an integer <VAR>k</VAR>.  If
<VAR>k</VAR> is outside the range of the list or string (i.e.  smaller than 1 or
greater than the length of the list or string), <CODE>E_RANGE</CODE> is raised.
Otherwise, the actual assignment takes place.  For lists, the variable or the
property is assigned a new list that is identical to the original one except at
the <VAR>k</VAR>-th position, where the new list contains the result of
<VAR>result-expr</VAR> instead.  For strings, the variable or the property is
assigned a new string that is identical to the original one, except the
<VAR>k</VAR>-th character is changed to be <VAR>result-expr</VAR>.

</P>
<P>
The assignment expression itself returns the value of <VAR>result-expr</VAR>.  For
the following examples, assume that <CODE>l</CODE> initially contains the list
<CODE>{1, 2, 3}</CODE> and that <CODE>s</CODE> initially contains the string "foobar":

</P>

<PRE>
l[5] = 3          error-->   E_RANGE
l["first"] = 4    error-->   E_TYPE
s[3] = "baz"      error-->   E_INVARG
l[2] = l[2] + 3   =>   5
l                 =>   {1, 5, 3}
l[2] = "foo"      =>   "foo"
l                 =>   {1, "foo", 3}
s[2] = "u"        =>   "u"
s                 =>   "fuobar"
s[$] = "z"        =>   "z"
s                 =>   "fuobaz"
</PRE>

<P>
Note that the <CODE>$</CODE> expression may also be used in indexed assignments with
the same meaning as before.

</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<EM>Fine point:</EM> After an indexed assignment, the variable or property
contains a <EM>new</EM> list or string, a copy of the original list in all but
the <VAR>k</VAR>-th place, where it contains a new value.  In programming-language
jargon, the original list is not mutated, and there is no aliasing.  (Indeed,
no MOO value is mutable and no aliasing ever occurs.)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
In the list case, indexed assignment can be nested to many levels, to work on
nested lists.  Assume that <CODE>l</CODE> initially contains the list

</P>

<PRE>
{{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, "foo"}
</PRE>

<P>
in the following examples:

</P>

<PRE>
l[7] = 4             error-->   E_RANGE
l[1][8] = 35         error-->   E_RANGE
l[3][2] = 7          error-->   E_TYPE
l[1][1][1] = 3       error-->   E_TYPE
l[2][2] = -l[2][2]   =>   -5
l                    =>   {{1, 2, 3}, {4, -5, 6}, "foo"}
l[2] = "bar"         =>   "bar"
l                    =>   {{1, 2, 3}, "bar", "foo"}
l[2][$] = "z"        =>   "z"
l                    =>   {{1, 2, 3}, "baz", "foo"}
</PRE>

<P>
The first two examples raise <CODE>E_RANGE</CODE> because 7 is out of the range of
<CODE>l</CODE> and 8 is out of the range of <CODE>l[1]</CODE>.  The next two examples
raise <CODE>E_TYPE</CODE> because <CODE>l[3]</CODE> and <CODE>l[1][1]</CODE> are not lists.
