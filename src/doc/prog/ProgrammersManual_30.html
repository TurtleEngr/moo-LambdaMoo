<P>
The simplest kind of statement is the <STRONG>null</STRONG> statement, consisting of just
a semicolon:

</P>

<PRE>
;
</PRE>

<P>
It doesn't do anything at all, but it does it very quickly.

</P>
<P>
The next simplest statement is also one of the most common, the expression
statement, consisting of any expression followed by a semicolon:

</P>

<PRE>
<VAR>expression</VAR>;
</PRE>

<P>
The given expression is evaluated and the resulting value is ignored.
Commonly-used kinds of expressions for such statements include
assignments and verb calls.  Of course, there's no use for such a
statement unless the evaluation of <VAR>expression</VAR> has some side-effect,
such as changing the value of some variable or property, printing some
text on someone's screen, etc.
