Patch pAS5:  by Alex Stewart, Oct  1, 1994
  Modifies bf_register.h, functions.c, Makefile, and Makefile.in
  Requires pAS5.c
  Adds the two builtin functions ctime_tz(<timezone> [,<time>]) and 
  mktime_tz(<timezone>, <year>, <monthnum>, <day>, <hour>, <min>, <sec>)
  which allow full timezone conversion and parsing based on unix tzfile 
  (timezone table) entries.
