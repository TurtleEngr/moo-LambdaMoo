<H3><A NAME="SEC16" HREF="ProgrammersManual_toc.html#TOC16">Values as True and False</A></H3>

<P>
There is a notion in MOO of <STRONG>true</STRONG> and <STRONG>false</STRONG> values; every value
is one or the other.  The true values are as follows:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

all integers other than zero,
<LI>

all floating-point numbers not equal to <CODE>0.0</CODE>,
<LI>

all non-empty strings (i.e., other than <SAMP>`""'</SAMP>), and
<LI>

all non-empty lists (i.e., other than <SAMP>`{}'</SAMP>).
</UL>

<P>
All other values are false:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

the integer zero,
<LI>

the floating-point numbers <CODE>0.0</CODE> and <CODE>-0.0</CODE>,
<LI>

the empty string (<SAMP>`""'</SAMP>),
<LI>

the empty list (<SAMP>`{}'</SAMP>),
<LI>

all object numbers, and
<LI>

all error values.
</UL>

<P>
There are four kinds of expressions and two kinds of statements that depend
upon this classification of MOO values.  In describing them, I sometimes refer
to the <STRONG>truth value</STRONG> of a MOO value; this is just <STRONG>true</STRONG> or
<STRONG>false</STRONG>, the category into which that MOO value is classified.

</P>
<P>
The conditional expression in MOO has the following form:

</P>

<PRE>
<VAR>expression-1</VAR> ? <VAR>expression-2</VAR> | <VAR>expression-3</VAR>
</PRE>

<P>
First, <VAR>expression-1</VAR> is evaluated.  If it returns a true value, then
<VAR>expression-2</VAR> is evaluated and whatever it returns is returned as the
value of the conditional expression as a whole.  If <VAR>expression-1</VAR> returns
a false value, then <VAR>expression-3</VAR> is evaluated instead and its value is
used as that of the conditional expression.

</P>

<PRE>
1 ? 2 | 3           =>  2
0 ? 2 | 3           =>  3
"foo" ? 17 | {#34}  =>  17
</PRE>

<P>
Note that only one of <VAR>expression-2</VAR> and <VAR>expression-3</VAR> is evaluated,
never both.

</P>
<P>
To negate the truth value of a MOO value, use the <SAMP>`!'</SAMP> operator:

</P>

<PRE>
! <VAR>expression</VAR>
</PRE>

<P>
If the value of <VAR>expression</VAR> is true, <SAMP>`!'</SAMP> returns 0; otherwise, it
returns 1:

</P>

<PRE>
! "foo"     =>  0
! (3 &#62;= 4)  =>  1
</PRE>

<P>
The negation operator is usually read as "not."

</P>
<P>
It is frequently useful to test more than one condition to see if some or all
of them are true.  MOO provides two operators for this:

</P>

<PRE>
<VAR>expression-1</VAR> &#38;&#38; <VAR>expression-2</VAR>
<VAR>expression-1</VAR> || <VAR>expression-2</VAR>
</PRE>

<P>
These operators are usually read as "and" and "or," respectively.

</P>
<P>
The <SAMP>`&#38;&#38;'</SAMP> operator first evaluates <VAR>expression-1</VAR>.  If it returns a
true value, then <VAR>expression-2</VAR> is evaluated and its value becomes the
value of the <SAMP>`&#38;&#38;'</SAMP> expression as a whole; otherwise, the value of
<VAR>expression-1</VAR> is used as the value of the <SAMP>`&#38;&#38;'</SAMP> expression.  Note
that <VAR>expression-2</VAR> is only evaluated if <VAR>expression-1</VAR> returns a true
value.  The <SAMP>`&#38;&#38;'</SAMP> expression is equivalent to the conditional expression

</P>

<PRE>
<VAR>expression-1</VAR> ? <VAR>expression-2</VAR> | <VAR>expression-1</VAR>
</PRE>

<P>
except that <VAR>expression-1</VAR> is only evaluated once.

</P>
<P>
The <SAMP>`||'</SAMP> operator works similarly, except that <VAR>expression-2</VAR> is
evaluated only if <VAR>expression-1</VAR> returns a false value.  It is equivalent
to the conditional expression

</P>

<PRE>
<VAR>expression-1</VAR> ? <VAR>expression-1</VAR> | <VAR>expression-2</VAR>
</PRE>

<P>
except that, as with <SAMP>`&#38;&#38;'</SAMP>, <VAR>expression-1</VAR> is only evaluated once.

</P>
<P>
These two operators behave very much like "and" and "or" in English:

</P>

<PRE>
1 &#38;&#38; 1                  =>  1
0 &#38;&#38; 1                  =>  0
0 &#38;&#38; 0                  =>  0
1 || 1                  =>  1
0 || 1                  =>  1
0 || 0                  =>  0
17 &#60;= 23  &#38;&#38;  23 &#60;= 27  =>  1
</PRE>
