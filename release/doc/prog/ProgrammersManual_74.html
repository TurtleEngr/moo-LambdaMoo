<P>
Whenever the <CODE>create()</CODE> function is used to create a new object, that
object's <CODE>initialize</CODE> verb, if any, is called with no arguments.  The call
is simply skipped if no such verb is defined on the object.

</P>
<P>
Symmetrically, just before the <CODE>recycle()</CODE> function actually destroys an
object, the object's <CODE>recycle</CODE> verb, if any, is called with no arguments.
Again, the call is simply skipped if no such verb is defined on the object.

</P>
<P>
Both <CODE>create()</CODE> and <CODE>recycle()</CODE> check for the existence of an
<CODE>ownership_quota</CODE> property on the owner of the newly-created or -destroyed
object.  If such a property exists and its value is an integer, then it is
treated as a <STRONG>quota</STRONG> on object ownership.  Otherwise, the following two
paragraphs do not apply.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>create()</CODE> function checks whether or not the quota is positive; if
so, it is reduced by one and stored back into the <CODE>ownership_quota</CODE>
property on the owner.  If the quota is zero or negative, the quota is
considered to be exhausted and <CODE>create()</CODE> raises <CODE>E_QUOTA</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>recycle()</CODE> function increases the quota by one and stores it back
into the <CODE>ownership_quota</CODE> property on the owner.
