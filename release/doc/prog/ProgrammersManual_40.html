<P>
One of the most important facilities in an object-oriented programming language
is ability for a child object to make use of a parent's implementation of some
operation, even when the child provides its own definition for that operation.
The <CODE>pass()</CODE> function provides this facility in MOO.

</P>

<DD><A NAME="IDX1"></A>
Often, it is useful for a child object to define a verb that <EM>augments</EM>
the behavior of a verb on its parent object.  For example, in the LambdaCore
database, the root object (which is an ancestor of every other object) defines
a verb called <SAMP>`description'</SAMP> that simply returns the value of
<CODE>this.description</CODE>; this verb is used by the implementation of the
<CODE>look</CODE> command.  In many cases, a programmer would like the description of
some object to include some non-constant part; for example, a sentence about
whether or not the object was `awake' or `sleeping'.  This sentence should be
added onto the end of the normal description.  The programmer would like to
have a means of calling the normal <CODE>description</CODE> verb and then appending
the sentence onto the end of that description.  The function <SAMP>`pass()'</SAMP> is
for exactly such situations.

</P>
<P>
<CODE>pass</CODE> calls the verb with the same name as the current verb but as
defined on the parent of the object that defines the current verb.  The
arguments given to <CODE>pass</CODE> are the ones given to the called verb and the
returned value of the called verb is returned from the call to <CODE>pass</CODE>.
The initial value of <CODE>this</CODE> in the called verb is the same as in the
calling verb.

</P>
<P>
Thus, in the example above, the child-object's <CODE>description</CODE> verb might
have the following implementation:

</P>

<PRE>
return pass() + "  It is " + (this.awake ? "awake." | "sleeping.");
</PRE>

<P>
That is, it calls its parent's <CODE>description</CODE> verb and then appends to the
result a sentence whose content is computed based on the value of a property on
the object.

</P>
<P>
In almost all cases, you will want to call <SAMP>`pass()'</SAMP> with the same
arguments as were given to the current verb.  This is easy to write in MOO;
just call <CODE>pass(@args)</CODE>.
