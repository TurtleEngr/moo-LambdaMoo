<H3><A NAME="SEC14" HREF="ProgrammersManual_toc.html#TOC14">Arithmetic Operators</A></H3>

<P>
All of the usual simple operations on numbers are available to MOO programs:

</P>

<PRE>
+    -    *    /    %
</PRE>

<P>
These are, in order, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and
remainder.  In the following table, the expressions on the left have the
corresponding values on the right:

</P>

<PRE>
5 + 2       =>   7
5 - 2       =>   3
5 * 2       =>   10
5 / 2       =>   2
5.0 / 2.0   =>   2.5
5 % 2       =>   1
5.0 % 2.0   =>   1.0
5 % -2      =>   1
-5 % 2      =>   -1
-5 % -2     =>   -1
-(5 + 2)    =>   -7
</PRE>

<P>
Note that integer division in MOO throws away the remainder and that the result
of the remainder operator (<SAMP>`%'</SAMP>) has the same sign as the left-hand
operand.  Also, note that <SAMP>`-'</SAMP> can be used without a left-hand operand to
negate a numeric expression.

</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<EM>Fine point:</EM> Integers and floating-point numbers cannot be mixed in any
particular use of these arithmetic operators; unlike some other programming
languages, MOO does not automatically coerce integers into floating-point
numbers.  You can use the <CODE>tofloat()</CODE> function to perform an explicit
conversion.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The <SAMP>`+'</SAMP> operator can also be used to append two strings.  The expression

</P>

<PRE>
"foo" + "bar"
</PRE>

<P>
has the value

</P>

<PRE>
"foobar"
</PRE>

<P>
Unless both operands to an arithmetic operator are numbers of the same kind
(or, for <SAMP>`+'</SAMP>, both strings), the error value <CODE>E_TYPE</CODE> is raised.  If
the right-hand operand for the division or remainder operators (<SAMP>`/'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`%'</SAMP>) is zero, the error value <CODE>E_DIV</CODE> is raised.

</P>
<P>
MOO also supports the exponentiation operation, also known as "raising to a
power," using the <SAMP>`^'</SAMP> operator:

</P>

<PRE>
3 ^ 4       =>   81
3 ^ 4.5     error-->   E_TYPE
3.5 ^ 4     =>   150.0625
3.5 ^ 4.5   =>   280.741230801382
</PRE>

<P>
Note that if the first operand is an integer, then the second operand must also
be an integer.  If the first operand is a floating-point number, then the
second operand can be either kind of number.  Although it is legal to raise an
integer to a negative power, it is unlikely to be terribly useful.
