<H3><A NAME="SEC33" HREF="ProgrammersManual_toc.html#TOC33">Terminating One or All Iterations of a Loop</A></H3>

<P>
Sometimes, it is useful to exit a loop before it finishes all of its
iterations.  For example, if the loop is used to search for a particular kind
of element of a list, then it might make sense to stop looping as soon as the
right kind of element is found, even if there are more elements yet to see.
The <SAMP>`break'</SAMP> statement is used for this purpose; it has the form

</P>

<PRE>
break;
</PRE>

<P>
or

</P>

<PRE>
break <VAR>name</VAR>;
</PRE>

<P>
Each <SAMP>`break'</SAMP> statement indicates a specific surrounding loop; if
<VAR>name</VAR> is not given, the statement refers to the innermost one.  If it is
given, <VAR>name</VAR> must be the name appearing right after the <SAMP>`for'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`while'</SAMP> keyword of the desired enclosing loop.  When the <SAMP>`break'</SAMP>
statement is executed, the indicated loop is immediately terminated and
executing continues just as if the loop had completed its iterations normally.

</P>
<P>
MOO also allows you to terminate just the current iteration of a loop, making
it immediately go on to the next one, if any.  The <SAMP>`continue'</SAMP> statement
does this; it has precisely the same forms as the <SAMP>`break'</SAMP> statement:

</P>

<PRE>
continue;
</PRE>

<P>
or

</P>

<PRE>
continue <VAR>name</VAR>;
</PRE>
