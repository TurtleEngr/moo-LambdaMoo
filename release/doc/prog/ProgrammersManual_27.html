<P>
As shown in a few examples above, MOO allows you to use parentheses to make it
clear how you intend for complex expressions to be grouped.  For example, the
expression

</P>

<PRE>
3 * (4 + 5)
</PRE>

<P>
performs the addition of 4 and 5 before multiplying the result by 3.

</P>
<P>
If you leave out the parentheses, MOO will figure out how to group the
expression according to certain rules.  The first of these is that some
operators have higher <STRONG>precedence</STRONG> than others; operators with higher
precedence will more tightly bind to their operands than those with lower
precedence.  For example, multiplication has higher precedence than addition;
thus, if the parentheses had been left out of the expression in the previous
paragraph, MOO would have grouped it as follows:

</P>

<PRE>
(3 * 4) + 5
</PRE>

<P>
The table below gives the relative precedence of all of the MOO
operators; operators on higher lines in the table have higher precedence
and those on the same line have identical precedence:

</P>

<PRE>
!       - (without a left operand)
^
*       /       %
+       -
==      !=      &#60;       &#60;=      &#62;       &#62;=      in
&#38;&#38;      ||
... ? ... | ... (the conditional expression)
=
</PRE>

<P>
Thus, the horrendous expression

</P>

<PRE>
x = a &#60; b &#38;&#38; c &#62; d + e * f ? w in y | - q - r
</PRE>

<P>
would be grouped as follows:

</P>

<PRE>
x = (((a &#60; b) &#38;&#38; (c &#62; (d + (e * f)))) ? (w in y) | ((- q) - r))
</PRE>

<P>
It is best to keep expressions simpler than this and to use parentheses
liberally to make your meaning clear to other humans.
