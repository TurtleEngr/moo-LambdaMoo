<DT><U>Function:</U> list <B>connected_players</B> <I>([<VAR>include-all</VAR>])</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX83"></A>
Returns a list of the object numbers of those player objects with
currently-active connections.  If <VAR>include-all</VAR> is provided and true, then
the list includes the object numbers associated with <EM>all</EM> current
connections, including ones that are outbound and/or not yet logged-in.

<DT><U>Function:</U> int <B>idle_seconds</B> <I>(obj <VAR>player</VAR>)</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX85"></A>
These functions return the number of seconds that the currently-active
connection to <VAR>player</VAR> has existed and been idle, respectively.  If
<VAR>player</VAR> is not the object number of a player object with a
currently-active connection, then <CODE>E_INVARG</CODE> is raised.

<DT><U>Function:</U> none <B>notify</B> <I>(obj <VAR>conn</VAR>, str <VAR>string</VAR> [, <VAR>no-flush</VAR>])</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX86"></A>
Enqueues <VAR>string</VAR> for output (on a line by itself) on the connection
<VAR>conn</VAR>.  If the programmer is not <VAR>conn</VAR> or a wizard, then
<CODE>E_PERM</CODE> is raised.  If <VAR>conn</VAR> is not a currently-active connection,
then this function does nothing.  Output is normally written to connections
only between tasks, not during execution.

</P>
<P>
The server will not queue an arbitrary amount of output for a connection; the
<CODE>MAX_QUEUED_OUTPUT</CODE> compilation option (in <SAMP>`options.h'</SAMP>) controls the
limit.  When an attempt is made to enqueue output that would take the server
over its limit, it first tries to write as much output as possible to the
connection without having to wait for the other end.  If that doesn't result in
the new output being able to fit in the queue, the server starts throwing away
the oldest lines in the queue until the new ouput will fit.  The server
remembers how many lines of output it has `flushed' in this way and, when next
it can succeed in writing anything to the connection, it first writes a line
like <CODE>&#62;&#62; Network buffer overflow: <VAR>X</VAR> lines of output to you have been
lost &#60;&#60;</CODE> where <VAR>X</VAR> is the number of flushed lines.

</P>
<P>
If <VAR>no-flush</VAR> is provided and true, then <CODE>notify()</CODE> never flushes any
output from the queue; instead it immediately returns false.  <CODE>Notify()</CODE>
otherwise always returns true.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Function:</U> int <B>buffered_output_length</B> <I>([obj <VAR>conn</VAR>])</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX87"></A>
Returns the number of bytes currently buffered for output to the connection
<VAR>conn</VAR>.  If <VAR>conn</VAR> is not provided, returns the maximum number of bytes
that will be buffered up for output on any connection.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Function:</U> str <B>read</B> <I>([obj <VAR>conn</VAR> [, <VAR>non-blocking</VAR>]])</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX88"></A>
Reads and returns a line of input from the connection <VAR>conn</VAR> (or, if not
provided, from the player that typed the command that initiated the current
task).  If <VAR>non-blocking</VAR> is false or not provided, this function suspends
the current task, resuming it when there is input available to be read.  If
<VAR>non-blocking</VAR> is provided and true, this function never suspends the
calling task; if there is no input currently available for input, <CODE>read()</CODE>
simply returns 0 immediately.

</P>
<P>
If <VAR>player</VAR> is provided, then the programmer must either be a wizard or the
owner of <CODE>player</CODE>; if <CODE>player</CODE> is not provided, then <CODE>read()</CODE>
may only be called by a wizard and only in the task that was last spawned by a
command from the connection in question.  Otherwise, <CODE>E_PERM</CODE> is raised.
If the given <CODE>player</CODE> is not currently connected and has no pending lines
of input, or if the connection is closed while a task is waiting for input but
before any lines of input are received, then <CODE>read()</CODE> raises
<CODE>E_INVARG</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
The restriction on the use of <CODE>read()</CODE> without any arguments preserves the
following simple invariant: if input is being read from a player, it is for the
task started by the last command that player typed.  This invariant adds
responsibility to the programmer, however.  If your program calls another verb
before doing a <CODE>read()</CODE>, then either that verb must not suspend or else
you must arrange that no commands will be read from the connection in the
meantime.  The most straightforward way to do this is to call

<PRE>
set_connection_option(player, "hold-input", 1)
</PRE>

<P>
before any task suspension could happen, then make all of your calls to
<CODE>read()</CODE> and other code that might suspend, and finally call

<PRE>
set_connection_option(player, "hold-input", 0)
</PRE>

<P>
to allow commands once again to be read and interpreted normally.
</DL>

<DT><U>Function:</U> none <B>force_input</B> <I>(obj <VAR>conn</VAR>, str <VAR>line</VAR> [, <VAR>at-front</VAR>])</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX89"></A>
Inserts the string <VAR>line</VAR> as an input task in the queue for the connection
<VAR>conn</VAR>, just as if it had arrived as input over the network.  If
<VAR>at_front</VAR> is provided and true, then the new line of input is put at the
front of <VAR>conn</VAR>'s queue, so that it will be the very next line of input
processed even if there is already some other input in that queue.  Raises
<CODE>E_INVARG</CODE> if <VAR>conn</VAR> does not specify a current connection and
<CODE>E_PERM</CODE> if the programmer is neither <VAR>conn</VAR> nor a wizard.

<DL>
<DT><U>Function:</U> none <B>flush_input</B> <I>(obj <VAR>conn</VAR> [<VAR>show-messages</VAR>])</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX90"></A>
Performs the same actions as if the connection <VAR>conn</VAR>'s defined flush
command had been received on that connection, i.e., removes all pending lines
of input from <VAR>conn</VAR>'s queue and, if <VAR>show-messages</VAR> is provided and
true, prints a message to <VAR>conn</VAR> listing the flushed lines, if any.  See
the chapter on server assumptions about the database for more information about
a connection's defined flush command.

<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Function:</U> list <B>output_delimiters</B> <I>(obj <VAR>player</VAR>)</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX91"></A>
Returns a list of two strings, the current <STRONG>output prefix</STRONG> and <STRONG>output
suffix</STRONG> for <VAR>player</VAR>.  If <VAR>player</VAR> does not have an active network
connection, then <CODE>E_INVARG</CODE> is raised.  If either string is currently
undefined, the value <CODE>""</CODE> is used instead.  See the discussion of the
<CODE>PREFIX</CODE> and <CODE>SUFFIX</CODE> commands in the next chapter for more
information about the output prefix and suffix.

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Function:</U> none <B>boot_player</B> <I>(obj <VAR>player</VAR>)</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX92"></A>
Marks for disconnection any currently-active connection to the given
<VAR>player</VAR>.  The connection will not actually be closed until the
currently-running task returns or suspends, but all MOO functions (such as
<CODE>notify()</CODE>, <CODE>connected_players()</CODE>, and the like) immediately behave
as if the connection no longer exists.  If the programmer is not either a
wizard or the same as <VAR>player</VAR>, then <CODE>E_PERM</CODE> is raised.  If there
is no currently-active connection to <VAR>player</VAR>, then this function does
nothing.

</P>
<P>
If there was a currently-active connection, then the following verb call is
made when the connection is actually closed:

</P>

<PRE>
$user_disconnected(<VAR>player</VAR>)
</PRE>

<P>
It is not an error if this verb does not exist; the call is simply skipped.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Function:</U> str <B>connection_name</B> <I>(obj <VAR>player</VAR>)</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX93"></A>
Returns a network-specific string identifying the connection being used by the
given player.  If the programmer is not a wizard and not <VAR>player</VAR>, then
<CODE>E_PERM</CODE> is raised.  If <VAR>player</VAR> is not currently connected, then
<CODE>E_INVARG</CODE> is raised.

</P>
<P>
For the TCP/IP networking configurations, for in-bound connections, the string
has the form

<PRE>
"port <VAR>lport</VAR> from <VAR>host</VAR>, port <VAR>port</VAR>"
</PRE>

<P>
where <VAR>lport</VAR> is the decimal TCP listening port on which the connection
arrived, <VAR>host</VAR> is either the name or decimal TCP address of the host from
which the player is connected, and <VAR>port</VAR> is the decimal TCP port of the
connection on that host.

</P>
<P>
For outbound TCP/IP connections, the string has the form

<PRE>
"port <VAR>lport</VAR> to <VAR>host</VAR>, port <VAR>port</VAR>"
</PRE>

<P>
where <VAR>lport</VAR> is the decimal local TCP port number from which the
connection originated, <VAR>host</VAR> is either the name or decimal TCP address of
the host to which the connection was opened, and <VAR>port</VAR> is the decimal TCP
port of the connection on that host.

</P>
<P>
For the System V `local' networking configuration, the string is the UNIX login
name of the connecting user or, if no such name can be found, something of the
form

<PRE>
"User #<VAR>number</VAR>"
</PRE>

<P>
where <VAR>number</VAR> is a UNIX numeric user ID.

</P>
<P>
For the other networking configurations, the string is the same for all
connections and, thus, useless.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Function:</U> none <B>set_connection_option</B> <I>(obj <VAR>conn</VAR>, str <VAR>option</VAR>, <VAR>value</VAR>)</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX94"></A>
Controls a number of optional behaviors associated the connection <VAR>conn</VAR>.
Raises <CODE>E_INVARG</CODE> if <VAR>conn</VAR> does not specify a current connection and
<CODE>E_PERM</CODE> if the programmer is neither <VAR>conn</VAR> nor a wizard.  The
following values for <VAR>option</VAR> are currently supported:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>"hold-input"</CODE>
<DD>
If <VAR>value</VAR> is true, then input received on <VAR>conn</VAR> will never be treated
as a command; instead, it will remain in the queue until retrieved by a call to
<CODE>read()</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>"client-echo"</CODE>
<DD>
Send the Telnet Protocol <SAMP>`WONT ECHO'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`WILL ECHO'</SAMP> command,
depending on whether <VAR>value</VAR> is true or false, respectively.  For clients
that support the Telnet Protocol, this should toggle whether or not the client
echoes locally the characters typed by the user.  Note that the server itself
never echoes input characters under any circumstances.  (This option is only
available under the TCP/IP networking configurations.)

<DT><CODE>"binary"</CODE>
<DD>
If <VAR>value</VAR> is true, then both input from and output to <VAR>conn</VAR> can
contain arbitrary bytes.  Input from a connection in binary mode is not broken
into lines at all; it is delivered to either the read() function or the
built-in command parser as <STRONG>binary strings</STRONG>, in whatever size chunks come
back from the operating system.  (See the early section on MOO value types for
a description of the binary string representation.)  For output to a connection
in binary mode, the second argument to `notify()' must be a binary string; if
it is malformed, E_INVARG is raised.

<DT><CODE>"flush-command"</CODE>
<DD>
If <VAR>value</VAR> is a non-empty string, then it becomes the new <STRONG>flush</STRONG>
command for this connection, by which the player can flush all queued input
that has not yet been processed by the server.  If <VAR>value</VAR> is not a
non-empty string, then <VAR>conn</VAR> is set to have no flush command at all.  The
default value of this option can be set via the property
<CODE>$server_options.default_flush_command</CODE>; see the chapter on server
assumptions about the database for details.
</DL>
</DL>

<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Function:</U> list <B>connection_options</B> <I>(obj <VAR>conn</VAR>)</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX95"></A>
Returns a list of <CODE>{<VAR>name</VAR>, <VAR>value</VAR>}</CODE> pairs describing the
current settings of all of the allowed options for the connection <VAR>conn</VAR>.
Raises <CODE>E_INVARG</CODE> if <VAR>conn</VAR> does not specify a current connection and
<CODE>E_PERM</CODE> if the programmer is neither <VAR>conn</VAR> nor a wizard.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Function:</U> value <B>connection_option</B> <I>(obj <VAR>conn</VAR>, str <VAR>name</VAR>)</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX96"></A>
Returns the current setting of the option <VAR>name</VAR> for the connection
<VAR>conn</VAR>.  Raises <CODE>E_INVARG</CODE> if <VAR>conn</VAR> does not specify a current
connection and <CODE>E_PERM</CODE> if the programmer is neither <VAR>conn</VAR> nor a
wizard.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Function:</U> obj <B>open_network_connection</B> <I>(<VAR>value</VAR>, ...)</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX97"></A>
Establishes a network connection to the place specified by the arguments and
more-or-less pretends that a new, normal player connection has been established
from there.  The new connection, as usual, will not be logged in initially and
will have a negative object number associated with it for use with
<CODE>read()</CODE>, <CODE>notify()</CODE>, and <CODE>boot_player()</CODE>.  This object number
is the value returned by this function.

</P>
<P>
If the programmer is not a wizard or if the <CODE>OUTBOUND_NETWORK</CODE> compilation
option was not used in building the server, then <CODE>E_PERM</CODE> is raised.  If
the network connection cannot be made for some reason, then other errors will
be returned, depending upon the particular network implementation in use.

</P>
<P>
For the TCP/IP network implementations (the only ones as of this writing that
support outbound connections), there must be two arguments, a string naming a
host (possibly using the numeric Internet syntax) and an integer specifying a TCP
port.  If a connection cannot be made because the host does not exist, the port
does not exist, the host is not reachable or refused the connection,
<CODE>E_INVARG</CODE> is raised.  If the connection cannot be made for other
reasons, including resource limitations, then <CODE>E_QUOTA</CODE> is raised.

</P>
<P>
The outbound connection process involves certain steps that can take quite a
long time, during which the server is not doing anything else, including
responding to user commands and executing MOO tasks.  See the chapter on
server assumptions about the database for details about how the server limits
the amount of time it will wait for these steps to successfully complete.

</P>
<P>
It is worth mentioning one tricky point concerning the use of this function.
Since the server treats the new connection pretty much like any normal player
connection, it will naturally try to parse any input from that connection as
commands in the usual way.  To prevent this treatment, you should use
<CODE>set_connection_option()</CODE> to set the <CODE>"hold-input"</CODE> option true on
the connection.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Function:</U> value <B>listen</B> <I>(obj <VAR>object</VAR>, <VAR>point</VAR> [, <VAR>print-messages</VAR>])</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX98"></A>
Create a new point at which the server will listen for network connections,
just as it does normally.  <VAR>Object</VAR> is the object whose verbs
<CODE>do_login_command</CODE>, <CODE>do_command</CODE>, <CODE>do_out_of_band_command</CODE>,
<CODE>user_connected</CODE>, <CODE>user_created</CODE>, <CODE>user_reconnected</CODE>,
<CODE>user_disconnected</CODE>, and <CODE>user_client_disconnected</CODE> will be called at
appropriate points, just as these verbs are called on <CODE>#0</CODE> for normal
connections.  (See the chapter on server assumptions about the database for the
complete story on when these functions are called.)  <VAR>Point</VAR> is a
network-configuration-specific parameter describing the listening point.  If
<VAR>print-messages</VAR> is provided and true, then the various
database-configurable messages (also detailed in the chapter on server
assumptions) will be printed on connections received at the new listening
point.  <CODE>Listen()</CODE> returns <VAR>canon</VAR>, a `canonicalized' version of
<VAR>point</VAR>, with any configuration-specific defaulting or aliasing accounted
for.

</P>
<P>
This raises <CODE>E_PERM</CODE> if the programmer is not a wizard, <CODE>E_INVARG</CODE> if
<VAR>object</VAR> is invalid or there is already a listening point described by
<VAR>point</VAR>, and <CODE>E_QUOTA</CODE> if some network-configuration-specific error
occurred.

</P>
<P>
For the TCP/IP configurations, <VAR>point</VAR> is a TCP port number on which to
listen and <VAR>canon</VAR> is equal to <VAR>point</VAR> unless <VAR>point</VAR> is zero, in
which case <VAR>canon</VAR> is a port number assigned by the operating system.

</P>
<P>
For the local multi-user configurations, <VAR>point</VAR> is the UNIX file name to
be used as the connection point and <VAR>canon</VAR> is always equal to <VAR>point</VAR>.

</P>
<P>
In the single-user configuration, the can be only one listening point at a
time; <VAR>point</VAR> can be any value at all and <VAR>canon</VAR> is always zero.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Function:</U> none <B>unlisten</B> <I>(<VAR>canon</VAR>)</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX99"></A>
Stop listening for connections on the point described by <VAR>canon</VAR>, which
should be the second element of some element of the list returned by
<CODE>listeners()</CODE>.  Raises <CODE>E_PERM</CODE> if the programmer is not a wizard and
<CODE>E_INVARG</CODE> if there does not exist a listener with that description.
</DL>

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Function:</U> list <B>listeners</B> <I>()</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX100"></A>
Returns a list describing all existing listening points, including the default
one set up automatically by the server when it was started (unless that one has
since been destroyed by a call to <CODE>unlisten()</CODE>).  Each element of the list
has the following form:

</P>

<PRE>
{<VAR>object</VAR>, <VAR>canon</VAR>, <VAR>print-messages</VAR>}
</PRE>

<P>
where <VAR>object</VAR> is the first argument given in the call to <CODE>listen()</CODE>
to create this listening point, <VAR>print-messages</VAR> is true if the third
argument in that call was provided and true, and <VAR>canon</VAR> was the value
returned by that call.  (For the initial listening point, <VAR>object</VAR> is
<CODE>#0</CODE>, <VAR>canon</VAR> is determined by the command-line arguments or a
network-configuration-specific default, and <VAR>print-messages</VAR> is true.)
</DL>

</P>
<P>
Please note that there is nothing special about the initial listening point
created by the server when it starts; you can use <CODE>unlisten()</CODE> on it just
as if it had been created by <CODE>listen()</CODE>.  This can be useful; for example,
under one of the TCP/IP configurations, you might start up your server on some
obscure port, say 12345, connect to it by yourself for a while, and then open
it up to normal users by evaluating the statments
